Interactive AI Learning Environment
Welcome to my Interactive AI Learning Environment - a hands-on exploration of artificial intelligence concepts and algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.
🎯 Overview
This repository serves as a practical learning laboratory where theoretical AI concepts from the AIMA textbook come to life through interactive implementations, experiments, and projects. Rather than just reading about AI algorithms, this environment allows you to see them in action, modify parameters, and understand their behavior through direct experimentation.
🚀 Featured Projects
The heart of this repository lies in the Projects section, where you'll find comprehensive implementations of key AI algorithms and techniques:
🧠 Reinforcement Learning

Q-Learning: Complete implementation with visualization of learning progress and policy evolution
Alpha Zero: Advanced game-playing AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search and neural networks

📊 Data Analysis & Machine Learning

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Interactive data exploration tools and visualization techniques
Neural Network Implementations: From scratch implementations of various neural architectures

🎮 Game AI & Search Algorithms

Game-Playing Agents: Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, and advanced game strategies
Pathfinding Algorithms: A*, Dijkstra, and other search techniques with interactive visualizations

🔍 Knowledge Representation & Reasoning

Logic-Based Systems: Propositional and first-order logic implementations
Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Interactive CSP solvers with step-by-step visualization

📚 Learning Philosophy
This environment follows the AIMA textbook structure while adding:

Interactive Visualizations: See algorithms work in real-time
Parameter Experimentation: Modify algorithm parameters and observe changes
Step-by-Step Execution: Understanding each phase of complex algorithms
Practical Applications: Real-world problem solving using AI techniques
